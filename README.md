# Expo Linking API Unreliable Deep Link Handling

This repository demonstrates a bug in Expo's `Linking` API concerning the inconsistent handling of deep links.  The app is designed to receive a custom URL scheme and process it. However, the `Linking` API fails to reliably handle these links, leading to unpredictable behavior. The code includes both a demonstration of the issue and a potential workaround.

## Problem Description

The core issue is that incoming deep links are not consistently handled by the Expo `Linking` API, even with correct setup.  The app will sometimes receive and process the deep link, while other times the deep link handling fails silently.  There are no descriptive error messages to guide debugging.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone the repository.
2. `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run the app using `expo start`.
4. Try opening a custom URL scheme link on a device or simulator (e.g., `myapp://mydata`).
5. Observe inconsistent behavior in the app's handling of the deep link.

## Workaround (Solution Provided)

The provided solution offers a potential workaround using more robust event listening and potentially incorporating a fallback mechanism.  This increases the chance of successfully processing a deep link.

## Additional notes:

The issue appears to manifest more frequently on certain Android devices and simulators. Further investigation is needed to pinpoint the exact cause.
